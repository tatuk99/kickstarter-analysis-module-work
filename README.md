# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This project was created in order to help Louise, a playwright, figure out which elements will make her play a success. This analysis is done with old crowdfunding data, helping narrow down the exact elements that have made older plays successful in the past. Our goal is to give Louise a roadmap to follow in order to set up her campaign for success. 
Overall, plays had pretty successful results in previous campaigns. The theater category had mostly positive results, and most plays were successful.
